# Lianas climbing mechanisms

This repository contains the R scripts used to main analyses and produce the figures for the manuscritp "Climbing mechanisms as a central trait to understand the ecology of lianas across the tropics" in Global Ecology and Biogegraphy. 
The Manuscript is accepted.

# Data

We synthesised data from peer-reviewed manscripts and open databases to build a dataset cointaining informaiton for 702 species of lianas. The data contains information for the type of climbing used by each liana species following the classification proposed by Speroto et al. (2020) "Towards a Standardization of Terminology of the Climbing Habit in Plants" [DOI: 10.1007/s12229-020-09218-y](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12229-020-09218-y), and information for five functional traits: individual leaf area (LA), specific leaf area (SLA), foliar nitrogen content per mass (Nmass), stem specific density (WD), and seed mass (SM).

# Framework used in the study

Liana species (woody climbers) may be classified into two main types of climbing on supports: passive and active mechanisms. Each group has different types of strategies. The upper blue arrow indicates an increase in complexity of the type of climbing mechanism from scrambler to tendril. The lower blue arrow indicates an increase in the maximum size (diameter) of the support to which each type of climbing mechanism can attach. Note that the constraint in size of the support is valid only for species with active climbing since species with passive climbing do not climb and pass over different supports.
