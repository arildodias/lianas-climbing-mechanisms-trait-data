# Lianas climbing mechanisms

This repository contains the R script used to main analyses and produce the figures for the manuscritp "Climbing mechanisms as a central trait to understand the ecology of lianas across the tropics" in Global Ecology and Biogegraphy. 
The Manuscript is under 'minor revisons'

# Data

We synthesised data from peer-reviewed manscripts and open databases to build a dataset cointaining informaiton for 702 species of lianas. The data contains information for the type of climbing used by each lianas following the classification proposed by Speroto et al. (2020) "Towards a Standardization of Terminology of the Climbing Habit in Plants" DOI: 10.1007/s12229-020-09218-y, and information for five functional traits: individual leaf area (LA), specific leaf area (SLA), foliar nitrogen content per mass (Nmass), stem specific density (WD), and seed mass (SM).
